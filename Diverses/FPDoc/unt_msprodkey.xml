 decoded binary key as hexadecimal.

  Keys used in newer versions of Windows starting with Windows 8, i.e. those
  containing an N anywhere in them, will also have their built-in checksum
  verified.  An error is printed to stderr if the checksum mismatches.

  The output for keys in the era of Windows Vista and 7 will be garbage.  This
  is because the keys have additional obfuscation.

  It will read and display the composite number for keys containing an N.
  This is not possible for older keys because the composite position varies
  wildly.
