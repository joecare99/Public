## DialEdit
A Designer for Dialogs for TurboVision and FreeVision

## FV+ (FV.p)
A modified Version of FreeVision able to be compiled in objFPC-Mode

## FV2
The start of a next-gen FreeVision<br/>
 still some (big)issues.<br/>
 with following design-principles:
- Using classes instead of objects
- classes are Unit-Tested as much as possible
- Using procedure-delegates for dialog events instead of message-numbers (but they still work for compatibility)
- enumerators instead of callback
- Stringlist is now the TStrings descended TStringList
- TView has a Canvas (TextCanvas) to handle the drawing 
- minimal hardware-dependency 

even comes with an example (reworked the fv/example )

## IDE+ (IDE.p)
A modified Version of FP (the IDE), able to be compiled in objFPC-Mode<br/>
Thanks to MarcoV it is the orginal IDE with the addition of a Project-Info-File.
This makes it possible to compile/debug it in Lazarus.

## Lazarus Bible
Inspiered by/updated from the Delphi-Bible by Tom Swan.<br/>
Some projects still need some care, some will not work due to a lack of components.<br/>
Suggestions are welcome.
