  { DefaultTranslator cannot execute code, i.e. strings combined by means of

    method here to get that label translated. }

  { There is a complication for the labels LblTodayIs which displays the current
    date, and with LblMoney which displays some amount of money with the currency
    sign.
    Formatting for these data is extracted from the DefaultFormatSettings.
    The resulting strings are encoded in ansi and do not display locale-specific
    characters. To get this right they have to be converted to UTF8.
    Usually, it is sufficient to call SysToUTF8 for this purpose. Our example,
    however, allows for Hebrew characters which are usually not contained in the
    typical code pages. Therefore, we use'll a more general procedure based on
    ConvertEncoding which allows to specify the source code page which had been
    determined when UpdateFormatSettings had been called in the LocalizedForms
    unit. }
